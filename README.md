# PowerPC Benchmarks

## Quick Info
This repo has a selection of some embedded related benchmarks, namely dhrystone, whetstone and coremark. For a project, these benchmarks are needed for a PowerPC architecture. The process was not as easy as expected, so I aim to facilitate this in case someone in the future needs it. One of the most important things is the powerpc-gcc-toolchain, which was generated by using buildroot, more on that in the respective repository: https://github.com/tdh0ang/powerpc-gcc-toolchain. 

## How To's
I tried making things as straightforward as possible by having a Makefile for each benchmark handling the compilation and cleanup process. I haven't got that much experience so it most likely is not up to standard or just messy, but should work. I'll provide more info in the respective benchmark folders. 

## Environment
For the project, the target is a 32-Bit PowerPC architecture with a MPC8548E Processor (e500 core). The goal is to run the benchmarks in this repo on this target. Specifically, the emulated target. We make use of QEMU/KVM for this, as well as buildroot for a linux kernel. To configure and compile the kernel for this target, buildroot needs to be installed. You can configure from scratch, or simply use some predefined default configs. 

In the buildroot directory you can find all those configs under configs/. To apply, simply do:

~~~
make qemu_ppc_mpc8544ds_defconfig
~~~

This will write some default configuration in the .config file. To configure things yourself, open the config menu with:

~~~
make menuconfig
~~~

This opens a user friendly GUI in the terminal, where you can click through and apply changes as you wish, as well as choosing packages to be installed. After finishing configuration, call make. 

As a note here: Dhrystone, Whetstone and CoreMark can be chosen as packages and buildroot will pull the source and compile automatically for the current selected target. 

You'll end up with the binary in your emulated system. For this project it was important for me to not be reliant on buildroot to do that, so I essentially looked at how buildroot does all the compilation, simplified and structured it for easier use. 

Compiling the kernel will take a lot of time, so dedicate your entire morning for this process. After this is finished, we can start a QEMU instance with:

~~~
./output/host/usr/bin/qemu-system-ppc \
  -M mpc8544ds \
  -cpu mpc8548e \
  -m 256 \
  -kernel output/images/vmlinux \
  -append 'console=ttyS0 root=/dev/ram0' \
  -initrd output/images/rootfs.cpio \
  -serial stdio \
  -display curses \
  -netdev user,id=net0,hostfwd=tcp::2222-:22 \
  -device e1000,netdev=net0
~~~

With this you can transfer files via SSH by using Secure Copy Protocol (SCP):

~~~
scp -P 2222 your_file  root@localhost:/
~~~

By using the above command, the file is put into the root directory of your QEMU instance and the benchmark binaries can finally be executed.
