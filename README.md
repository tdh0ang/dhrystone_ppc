# PowerPC Benchmarks

## Quick Info
This repo has a selection of some embedded related benchmarks, namely dhrystone, whetstone and coremark. For a project, these benchmarks are needed for a PowerPC architecture. The process was not as easy as expected, so I aim to facilitate this in case someone in the future needs it. One of the most important things is the powerpc-gcc-toolchain, which was generated by using buildroot, more on that in the respective repository: https://github.com/tdh0ang/powerpc-gcc-toolchain. 

## How To's
I tried making things as straightforward as possible by having a Makefile for each benchmark handling the compilation and cleanup process. I haven't got that much experience so it most likely is not up to standard or just messy, but should work. I'll provide more info in the respective benchmark folders.
