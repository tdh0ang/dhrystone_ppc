# Paranoia Benchmark Compilation for PowerPC

## General Information
Paranoia test the floating point arithmetic implementation on a copmuter. Some information can be found here: https://people.math.sc.edu/Burkardt/c_src/paranoia/paranoia.html. It was originally written by Professor William Kahan in BASIC, the one here is written in C. All the versions are available here: https://www.netlib.org/paranoia/index.html. 

## How it works
Compiling this benchmark is quite simple, just call make and the compilation process should start and produce the paranoia executable.
