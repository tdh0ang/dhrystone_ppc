# Paranoia Benchmark Compilation for PowerPC

## General Information
Paranoia test the floating point arithmetic implementation on a copmuter. Some information can be found here: https://people.math.sc.edu/Burkardt/c_src/paranoia/paranoia.html. It was originally written by Professor William Kahan in BASIC, the one here is written in C. All the versions are available here: https://www.netlib.org/paranoia/index.html. 

## How it works
Compiling this benchmark is quite simple, just call make and the compilation process should start and produce the paranoia executable.

## How to use
After successful compilation, execute the file:

```bash
./paranoia
``` 

Paranoia is straightforward, it'll show what each step is doing and you continue by pressing enter. Nothing more than that. At the end it'll tell you the general results, while more specific results are provided after each step.
