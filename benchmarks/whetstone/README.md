# Dhrystone Benchmark Compilation for PowerPC

## General Information
The Whetstone benchmark primarily measures the floating-point arithmetic performance. It was first written in ALGOL 60 in 1972 at the Technical Support Unit of the Department of Trade and Industry (later part of the Central Computer and Telecommunications Agency) in the United Kingdom (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whetstone_(benchmark)).

## How it works
Compilation is simple, just call make and it should compile and link the binary for you.
